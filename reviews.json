I\u2019m lucky she didn\u2019t break off and swallow any pieces.Knowing Prime Day in July was approaching, I impatiently waited thinking I could get a new kindle for a better price than was listed.I wasn\u2019t disappointed. I bought it with ads and 3 months of Kindle Unlimited for $50 off the regular price.  Readers who are afraid of a Kindle with ads don\u2019t need to be.  The ads appear when you open the Kindle and appear on the bottom of the page. Once you open a book, all ads disappear and DO NOT INTERFERE WITH YOUR READING.  I stress this because it seems people unnecessarily pay more for a kindle without ads when they don\u2019t need to.I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because I have a different internet provider or if it\u2019s the new paper white, but books download in less than 5 seconds, which is great because I have hundred of books on it.One thing about the old paper white I didn\u2019t like was that if you made a collection, the books still remained on the list in the main library, so they\u2019re on the kindle twice taking up unnecessary storage space. I haven\u2019t made any collections yet as I\u2019m still downloading the hundreds of books from my Amazon account that I\u2019ve collected since my first kindle many many years ago.While I\u2019m a lover of real books, I had to stopbuying them because I have no more room. I have one bookcase with a complete set of Stephen King books in hardcover, and another bookcase with various books I\u2019ve kept - science, bios, history - but everything now is on my Kindle.  I love it because I can stick it my purse and it doesn\u2019t really add any extra weight.  This is important because I\u2019ve had 2 surgeries on each arm following a car accident, so my arms are not as strong as they used to be.I also use my kindle to borrow library books. What\u2019s great about it is you don\u2019t have to run to the library in the middle of a snow storm to return a book that\u2019s due. If you don\u2019t return the book yourself, kindle returns it and it disappears from your kindle.And then there\u2019re the free books offered by Amazon. I downloaded the complete set of Dickens\u2019 works - for free.  I can\u2019t even begin to tell you the number of classics I\u2019ve downloaded for free as well. I\u2019ll probably die before I read everything on my Kindle!One thing I would never do is leave my kindle unprotected without using a cover.  I have no intention of using my new kindle until the cover comes tomorrow.  I\u2019m notorious for carelessness  - my second iPad was only 18 months old when \u201csomehow\u201d the screen cracked - and it had a protective case. It\u2019s my second iPad because I accidentally stepped on the first one and shattered the screen. That one was in a case too.  My iPhone has deep scratches as well even though it is in a case \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I\u2019m looking forward to this new case because it has a strap I can slip my hand through making it easy to read with one hand without worrying about accidentally dropping it.It was well worth waiting for Prime Day.", "title": "Lighter than ever", "location_and_date": "Reviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on July 14, 2023", "verified": true, "rating": "5.0"},

{"asin": "B09RD7XM9X", "text": "OK, I fouled up with my Kindle Paperwhite 11th edition purchase. It was Prime Day and the Kindle was marked WAY DOWN, and I opted for the bundle: Kindle + Charger + fabric cover. Now don't get me wrong, the Charger is nice and the fabric cover is very nice, but for a device Amazon says you only need to charge 5 times a year, getting a premium charger doesn't really make much sense. I already have plenty of chargers, and the Kindle will charge overnight whether I use their super-fast premium charger or something else. And while the case is undeniably nice, you can get one for less than half the money from other sellers on Amazon.I did not make the mistake of getting the ad-free version. The ad appears on the lock screen and as soon as you swipe the screen, it goes away and stays away for your entire reading session. It's 100% unobtrusive. Other people have given the Kindle one star because they bought the ad-free version, and were angry there are still \"suggestions\" on the Home screen that they  consider ads. All I can say is that you get that no matter what, and the solution is to switch to the Library screen rather than the Home screen; that's very easy on the latest software version.The other huge mistake I made over 4 years ago was subscribing to Kindle Unlimited and somehow not knowing that it was automatically renewing silently every month (for $9.99). I paid enough to buy several Kindles. I guess I thought it was part of Amazon Prime or just something that comes with a Kindle. You can bundle Kindle Unlimited \"Free\" for 3 months with your Kindle purchase, but just watch out when that 3 months are over. I have generally found Kindle Unlimited books second rate (with a few exceptions).I bought one of the original Kindle Fire versions and the first Kindle Fire HD. They were cool, but I didn't end up using them much. They didn't have good battery life, they were hard to read outdoors, and Kindle software on other portable devices was fine. I think the first one eventually failed, and I gave the HD away to someone who needed to do something that required a Kindle. I have a nice Windows tablet.But I have always wanted a Paperwhite because of its long battery life and superb readability outdoors. Plus it was heavily discounted on Prime Day and I bought one.So how did it live up to expectations? Pretty well. The \"10 weeks\" battery life claim seems exaggerated, but still if you pick it up to go somewhere, it will probably be charged and last another day. Outdoor readability is simply amazing.After receiving the device, the software updated. I think it updated twice. My \"Experimental Web Browser\" turned into the \"Web Browser\" and the navigation improved markedly (addressing issues I read in other 1-star reviews). The web browser is still very limited and doesn't display some web pages correctly (like the Internet  Archive), and error messages still mention the \"Experimental\" browser. You can't access YouTube, for example, Twitter doesn't seem to work at all, and the New York Times is not readable.On books, three-level table of contents don't work on the Kindle, although they work on Kindle for PC.I had a very good experience emailing a PDF document downloaded from our local Planning Commission to the Kindle. Things you send to the Kindle arrive very fast. Amazon did, however, require me to verify myself as a sender before it would deliver email attachments to the Kindle, even though my email address is on the approved senders list at Amazon. Also plugging the Kindle to a PC lets you drag and drop supported document types (notably MOBI and PDF) to the Kindle where the immediately appear in your Library. The Send to Kindle for PC app is currently broken as reported by me and others on Amazon forums.The device is somewhat sluggish in general with a 1-second delay for most things: swipes, scrolls and navigation. That's certainly not something that would interfere with reading a book. There are so many different ways to navigate, that it can appear jumbled and confusing, plus the software updates I got changed everything, making me re-learn the UI. I think in the end that I will be accustomed to it and it will appear more natural.One severe limitation is that you cannot play audio files in general. While it supports Bluetooth headphones for books from Audible, it cannot play music or audio books in general. (I hope this is enhanced in a future software update.)So should you buy one of these? If you want to sit outdoors under a tree or at the beach for hours on end reading a book, a Kindle Paperwhite makes a lot of sense. The reading experience is good, it's visually sharp and the charge lasts a long time. If you want to listen to music, or do much of anything else you can do on a phone or a tablet computer, you're out of luck.", "title": "First impressions, should you buy one, and how to save money", "location_and_date": "Reviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on July 23, 2022", "verified": true, "rating": "4.0"},
{"asin": "B09RD7XM9X", "text": "This Kindle was purchased to replace a still-in-service original Paperwhite bought in Oct 2012.  Its battery was starting to hold it's charge for shorter and shorter times.Functionally, it still works fine, if I disregard the now-degraded battery life.  I use it daily, averaging over an hour of use.This new Kindle is a bit of a mixed-bag.The return window on it has just closed, so my dithering on whether or not to return it is now moot.I read some feedback suggesting that the display, while higher-dot-pitch, was a bit fuzzy (due to the flush touch-screen) and seemed to be something of a fingerprint magnet.  I discounted those comments before purchasing.I was surprised to discover that the fingerprint issue *is* a real thing and can, at times, be distracting.  The slight degradation in clarity seems to be balanced off against the higher dot-pitch.  This goes hand-in-hand with the flush-front design.  I'd like it more without the fingerprints being so much more noticeable.After a month, the charge on the new unit dropped low enough for me to plug it in for a full charge.  Their published battery-life estimates have always been based on what I consider very light usage levels.  But certainly reasonable and easy to extrapolate battery lifetime with heavier usage.One of the worst parts of the Kindle experience from the beginning is the totally tone-deaf view of the readers by the software development team (or, more accurately, their management).  They actively go out of their way to deny the end user the ability to customize their Kindles.  Locking down the system to prevent any third-party software access.  (\"have [it] painted any color he wants as long as it's black\")I was greatly saddened when I discovered that the current generation of the reader OS has been hardened enough to so-far stymied the developer community.I look forward to the day they break it.  And break it hard.My original Paperwhite has been jailbroken/hacked/rooted/customized so I could tweak its settings.  And it's been in airplane mode for a decade.  I side-load everything I read.  *Nothing* goes over the air.I like reading with *very* little margin on the page.  I already have a quarter-inch bezel on the device, I want to put more words on the page, narrowing the side margins even more than the narrowest option currently available to the native operating system.  My old PW is set that way.I like having custom lock-screen images on my unit.  I have a directory full of images in the original that get randomly shuffled and picked each time the lock screen comes up.  The new unit has the original tiny collection provided by the OS that feels old after a month with no access to the storage directory.How difficult would it be to give access to an image directory for the end user with the desire to do so?  *That* should be easy to implement.  It's not like that would be a directory full of executables.If someone can tickle the unit into *executing code through an image file*, then your team might want to reconsider being in the OS business.It also seems like the price differential between the 8GB and 16GB models has dropped since I purchased my unit only five weeks ago.I would probably have sprung for the extra RAM, even though I doubt it would be useful in my case unless I got into audiobooks in a big way.I've been using the blue-white light on the original reader for so long that I haven't felt the need to go out of my way to use the 'warm-light' feature on the new one.  I *have* set the automatic time-based adjustment feature and it is in use during nighttime reads, but it hasn't had a noticeable impact (positive or negative) on my habitual reading.  It probably does improve reading for many people, though.", "title": "Does everything as advertised, but would be better with more customization ability", "location_and_date": "Reviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on May 13, 2023", "verified": true, "rating": "4.0"},

As an avid book lover, I've always cherished the feel of physical books, but the Paperwhite has won me over with its incredible features and convenience.First and foremost, the display is nothing short of impressive. The high-resolution screen provides crystal-clear text that rivals the printed page. Whether I'm reading in broad daylight or in a dimly lit room, the built-in front light ensures a glare-free and comfortable reading experience. The adjustable font sizes are a boon for readers with varying visual preferences, allowing me to customize the text to my liking.The lightweight and compact design of the Kindle Paperwhite make it incredibly portable. I can easily slip it into my bag and take it with me wherever I go. Gone are the days of lugging around heavy books during travels or commutes. With my entire library at my fingertips, I now have access to a vast collection of e-books on a single device. The 8 GB storage capacity provides ample space for all my favorite reads, and I can even choose to expand it further if needed.One feature that sets the Paperwhite apart is its remarkable battery life. It lasts for weeks on a single charge, allowing me to indulge in hours of uninterrupted reading without worrying about running out of power. This is particularly handy during long trips or when I'm engrossed in a gripping story and can't put it down.Navigating through the Kindle interface is intuitive and user-friendly. I love how easy it is to purchase and download e-books directly from the Kindle Store. The syncing feature ensures that my progress is seamlessly updated across all my devices, be it my Kindle, smartphone, or tablet. This means I can pick up right where I left off, regardless of which device I'm using.Lastly, I must mention the added benefits of Kindle Unlimited and Prime Reading. With Kindle Unlimited, I have access to an extensive library of e-books and audiobooks, allowing me to explore new authors and genres. Prime Reading offers a rotating selection of popular titles at no additional cost, further enhancing my reading options.In conclusion, the Kindle Paperwhite has revolutionized the way I read. Its exceptional display, portability, long battery life, and seamless integration with the Kindle ecosystem have made it an indispensable companion for any book enthusiast.

{"asin": "B09RD7XM9X", "text": "PROS: Well, I REALLY like the 11th Gen over my 7th Gen.  I'll do it in 4 points:1-Larger Screen.. Nice2-Color Temp adjustment for the screen.  My background is photography so to me the new screen goes from say 8000 degrees Kelvin to about 2500 degrees Kelvin.  I'm happy around 4700-50003-LONGER battery life.. like 2 months vs 3 weeks4- USB-C!! YES! (my old microUSB was always getting wobbly.I did not mention the increase from \"4\"GB to \"8\"GB..because ..well. in the 7th Gen  the 4GB  is actually 3.1GB  with the rest taken up by the OS  on the new one.. it's actually...wait for it.. 6.25GB! Yep  the OS went from .9GB to 1.75GB!  A bit piggy for me.  I made a joke with a few of the Kindle Tech people that they got ideas from Windows Vista!.  Most got the joke.CONS: Now  onto issues..several which are really for how I use my Kindle:1- ok  the not quite 8GB issue.  Hey  I understand the increase in size..but how about making Audible a CHOICE.. you can add it or make it optional.  If you take away Bluetooth support and Audible..maybe we might gain some space back.  (Personally I use nice plug-in headphones.  I really only see Audible BT when on a long drive in the car..like music.  But then again, you can just put it in a format like MP3 and play it thru the car.  I have the entire Hitchhiker's Guide Radio Broadcasts like that)2- BIG (to me ) BUG  the issue?  as in the photograph.. I use Amazon Cloud Collections.  I organize my ebooks (most I got before I got the kindles)  using Calibre.  So  when I set up series, I use the Series name, or I use the Author, or Subject as a title for the Collections.  sometimes, (as in the case of the Dune series), books are added that happened in-between earlier books that came out.  So when that happens I will add the book. And when you have a series of say 11 books, 9 of which came out years ago, I'll add the book as the following:  01-Dune  02-Dune Messiah  03-Children of Dunethen 3 books were added.. Tales of Dune. Paul of Dune, and The Winds of Dune.In my older 7th Gen PW it showed like this:  00-Tales of Dune  01-Dune  01.5-Paul of Dune  02-Dune Messiah  02.5-the Winds of Dune  03-Children of DuneBUT, As the photograph shows, the new 11th Gen PaperWhite has a bug!  00-Tales of Dune  01.5-Paul of Dune  01-Dune  02.5-the Winds of Dune  02-Dune Messiah  03-Children of DuneThis should REALLY be addressed!3-This is not so much a Kindle PW issue, as so much it's an Amazon issue.  and it deals with the Amazon Cloud Collections.  As I use Calibre, and I have a LOT of books that were originally Epubs, I used Calibre to convert them and organize them into series.  And after various different methods, including sideloading from the computer, I decided to use the Cloud Collections.  So I sent ALL of my converted epubs (now mobi files) to Amazon and used the website to organize them into the collections.  Which went very well ....at first.First..about 2-3 years ago, Amazon removed the ability to send the Collection to Device.  So now I HAVE to use the actual PW to get my Collections onto my Kindle.  Recently, Amazon changed the display format on the pages  on how they show books and doc files. And if you want to add a book or doc to a collection, it's now incredibly tedious! Formally when you did  a box would open that would let you start typing the name of the collection, or make a new collection.  All in one box.  NOW, a box open which shows 2 or 3 collections.. not in any order other than Recent..with a check box!  You can't find the collection by typing the title.. you can only scroll..and it only shows 2 collections at a time.  That's fine if you have 6 collections.. but I have 49 page of 5 COLLECTIONS EACH!!!  PLEASE PLEASE PUT BACK THE OLD WAY OR ADD A SEARCH OPTION!!  You've actually found a way that is so much more tedious than the actual Paperwhite!!!!! you can't even make a new one on there.. you have to go back to the collection Tab.. THEN go back to the doc or book tab and start all over!  Please go back to the old way !!!4- the new Library Series option.  It only works for purchased books, not docs.  also, I had to call up because it grouped two books together, in a series..(nice), but then stuck on e of the GRAYED OUT, above the first collection.. only in Download.  I found out I had to do a Reboot after turning Library option off. (I ended up putting the two books in a collection.. like I like.Well  that's about it.  btw  I  ALWAYS use the LIST vs GRID option.. and using HOME is no longer a nice choice.  I prefer when HOME was the same as LIBRARY .. in my case..the first collection, and all the collections after which comes the books in Recent ordernow... waiting for a dark brown cork case.______________________________________Slight update or comment on the software version.  My wife and I both upgraded to the 11th Gen.  Her's came with her case..Amazon Black Leather,  while I wait for the cork.  Her 11th gen came with 5.14.1 1,  while mine came with 5.14.0 .  I was a bit surprised since both were ordered at the same time. And arrived together.  But, not a big issue, since eventually all units will be on the latest software.  So? What to do?  I've read a LOT on here about complaints  it's so hard, I know.Since my \"update\" was grayed out,  I just downloaded the latest version and put it on my 11th gen,  and rebooted..and BINGO!  No problem,  I now have the latest software.Now fix the real BUG I addressed and fix the \"Manage Your Content\" pages regarding using Cloud Collections.  Oh, while you're at it, fix the damn Amazon Android App so I can work with Cloud Collections via the App. And not just my tower.

{"asin": "B09RD7XM9X", "text": "I enjoyed my 2013 Kindle for the last 9 years. It is what basically got me into reading as an adult. Up until now, I never saw a reason to upgrade. I got the previous model last year. It had the Bluetooth and water resistance. Two features I could care less about. If I'm going to listen to audible, it's because I don't have my paperwhite with me. As far as water, I've always had a sea to summit device bag to protect it if I wanted to do a little hot tub reading. But aside from those two features, there wasn't much new. Even the response time was near identical despite eight years apart. It wasn't enough of an upgrade to keep, so I gave it to my mom.One year later, my desires have been answered. Larger screen, faster response, warm mode back light. This one is much faster than the previous generations. It feels so much better to have pages turn when you tap the screen rather than 1.5 seconds+ later.For what to buy, do not waste your money on the ad free version. It doesn't get rid of suggestions that appear below your book list. It just adds a swipe to open prompt when you open the cover. And frankly, I HAVE bought books before that appeared there. Plus it also adds a little protection to accidental touch. To pay a one time fee on something you're already buying to remove ads from the platform you're basically required to buy books from is fairly hokey. But whatever.I love the new warm light feature. You can set it to follow your local sunset schedule, which is nice. It overall gives it a nicer reading a real book under incandescent light feel.The wider screen is a nice addition. I don't know if this is a complaint because obviously I don't want the device bigger. But my reading in bed while laying down is harder because I used to grasp it on the edges. Now there's no real edge to speak of, so keep that in mind.Main reason for one removed star is the battery life. I finally recharged somewhere in week 5 when I got into the teens. For the record, I don't turn off wifi when I'm not using it. I like to turn on hotspot on my phone and have my kindle quickly sync reading. I also never did on my old one. That one lasted a solid 2+ months for years. This one does not appear to have that longevity. For the record, I do not have the power save mode turned on. I found it to be way too obtrusive. You have to wait a few seconds for it to wake up when you bring it out. But the biggest reason was, while I always have the backlight set to like 5-10 brightness and medium warm, during this wake up, the screen would be bright and full white. This is not something I enjoy when I am trying to get to sleep. So I sacrifice battery life for that experience. Keep in mind, my old model didn't even have a battery save feature. So I'm not sure where that life is going.In conclusion, up until this year, unless you had managed to break yours, I wouldn't have recommended an upgrade unless you really need the Bluetooth or water resistance. This one, however, has definitely sold me. While I wish there were more user controlled features and settings, it's an overall great experience.", "title": "A worthy upgrade.", "location_and_date": "Reviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on May 24, 2023", "verified": true, "rating": "4.0"},
{"asin": "B09RD7XM9X", "text": "Kindle Signature Paperwhite plus Charging StandI own the 11th Gen (newest model 2022) standard Kindle Paperwhite and the Signature Paperwhite. I love them both. If dough is not the issue, I would buy the Signature model for fifty bucks more. Here\u2019s some of my particular findings in use.Cases: Note that I do not like the Amazon cases because I don\u2019t like folding over cover type cases; I prefer cases that simply help with holding the device.  I purchased the \u201cMoKo Case for 6.8\" Kindle Paperwhite (11th Generation-2021) and Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, Ultra Clear Soft Flexible Transparent TPU Skin Bumper Back Cover Shell, Clear\u201d from Amazon and it fits the Kindle ideally, and most importantly this case DOES go on the proprietary charging stand made by Anker and the charge does go through the case (that is, I do not need to remove the case to charge the Kindle in that charging stand).Battery: Amazon states that the Kindle 11th gen will hold a charge for 10 weeks, when used at limited brightness for 90 minutes a day (and a lot of other stipulations, like WiFi and Bluetooth off, etc). In reality, many may turn up the brightness, read more than 90 minutes, and Airplane mode on, or use other features that drain the battery faster (See audiobooks below). I have found that my battery drains faster than 10 weeks, but I am using the device with Airplane mode off, Wifi on, Bluetooth On. I do not like turning off wifi in particular because it MUST Be on to sync books between devices, and since I have two Kindle 11th gens, plus a MacBook, iPhone, iPad, and I read 5 books at a time simultaneously, I have no desire to turn wi-fi off.  Thus, having Qi charging is helpful\u2026not mandatory but helpful.  Another BIG reason for the Qi charging is Audible audiobooks. I do listen to them through the Kindle itself, and the battery drains fairly quickly when listening to audiobooks.Memory Storage: The Kindle has 8 GB storage, but only 5.8 GB after their software OS.  The Signature Kindle has 32 GB storage, but only 28 GB after their software OS (there is slightly different software between the two models as the Signature supports more menu and charging features). So if you love downloaded \u201coff-line\u201d reading, and in particular if you enjoy having audiobooks in your downloaded library (they take much more storage than an e-book), the 32 GB is reassuring.Auto-light adjust: I can\u2019t even detect that it\u2019s doing anything, but if one rides a train daily to work and it passes through dark tunnels, this feature may be of benefit to you.Advertising free: Many forget the $20 value of the ad-free that is part of the Kindle Signature.  Even those that wouldn\u2019t pony up for it on their own may enjoy it here as \u201cicing on the cake\u201d for the price difference.  I like seeing my own book cover on the sleep screen, and that is not possible with the \u201cwith ads\u201d version. I thought I enjoyed the ads for editors choice books and book sales and stuff, but I much prefer the ad-free model.  And, little discussed fact, the ad-free version has one less swipe to get to your Library or current book every single time you turn on the Kindle. True!Dedicated Signature Charger Stand: I bought the Qi charging stand and like it greatly.  It does work with my \u201cMoKo Case for 6.8\" Kindle Paperwhite (11th Generation-2021) and the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, Ultra Clear Soft Flexible Transparent TPU Skin Bumper Back Cover Shell, Clear\u201d., and charges through the case and the case fits the stand (but not quite as bump-proof as the Kindle without the case). I like that the stand sits quietly on my desk as I am working, or on my coffee table while I\u2019m watching sports do I can read during commercials. I do not need to keep the AC cord attached to the stand at all times; sometimes I use the charger stand as simply a free-standing stand for either of my Kindles. I like that it can hold my Kindle 11th generation normal edition without Qi charging and I can read on it as an easel stand.  I feel the utility as an easel stand is underrated. Qi chargers in general are not free, and neither are easel stands, so coupling those two together, you get the price of this Anker model.  I find no issues with the size of the \u201cwall wart\u201d or the plug in the back of the stand. Some people complain with the charging stand that the white light indicator does not turn to another color, such as green, to indicate full charge.  A \u201cwork around\u201d for this is to place the charging Kindle on the stand upside down; now the LED light at the bottom of the Kindle device itself, which does change color when fully charged, is face upward and easily seen. Frankly, there is no issue with simply assuming the Signature PW is charged after an hour or two. I like this stand much more than I thought I would.I\u2019ve owned every Kindle since the first one! I use library Libby, and am an Audible and Kindle Unlimited subscribers. I guess you could say I\u2019m a \u201cpower user\u201d. I definitely prefer the Signature version, but both are good readers.  If I could change one thing about these Kindles, it would be to add a physical button like the Oasis. I realize that sounds outdated, but to reach and switch with the other hand, or reach thumb across screen to scrub, every page turn is a chore that is solved with an under-thumb button like Oasis. Additionally, the e-ink is good, but after two decades, one would think the text versus background contrast would be better\u2026that is, darker text, whiter background. Instead, it remains darkest gray text in lightest gray background, not ideal.

{"asin": "B09RD7XM9X", "text": "The first thing I thought of when I saw an e-reader was AWESOME! But that was before they introduced the paperwhite models. In essence, they were amazon branded android tablets. They were slow and clunky and incredibly cheap. I'm further embarrassed to admit my first e-reader was actually a Barnes & Noble Nook. Which - if anything - was worse than the original Kindle's.I also discovered that I just plain missed holding a book. I couldn't explain it but I know a lot of people understand what I'm talking about. There is just something about being able to physically hold that book in my hands that just felt \"right\" and the e-readers just did not provide that.Finally amazon introduced the paperwhite and that was an absolute game changer. The ability to read a Kindle in direct sunlight was just unheard of. The older color versions were essentially useless in direct sun, or even marginally cloudy days as well. I still preferred holding a book in my hands though. But that all changed one night when I couldn't sleep and I tried to read at 1am and couldn't get ANY light to work well enough while also trying to hold my hard back book and not wake up my wife. It became a challenge of monumental proportions (at least for me it was). Slowly, over the course of the next 6 months, I began to warm up to the idea of giving the Kindle another try.This is where I made a big mistake however. Instead of buying it new, I went with a reputable company that sold reconditioned electronics for a deep discount. My reasoning seemed solid (at the time), if I ended up not truly enjoying my Kindle, at least I hadn't wasted too much $$ on buying a new one. Unfortunately, the model I received was tied to the account of the former owner, and I wasn't able to correct that with a simple master reset. It took several days to work thru that problem, but once I did, I was off and running. I got a slightly smaller model (6\" screen) and while it functioned, it stuttered so often I forgot just how smooth it really should've been. But still, even with the issues, the hiccups and stuttering, I grew to really enjoy using it and more importantly, I loved the battery life it offered.I decided it was time for an upgrade, and this time I was going all-in. I got the 6.8\" screen, which isn't that much bigger, but it DOES make a difference. Since I ordered directly from amazon this time, imagine my absolute surprise when I turned it on I was worried that it was going to take forever to link up to my WiFi and have to add my amazon account information...but that did not happen. Not sure if amazon pre-programmed it, but as soon as I turned it on it said, \"Welcome Jeff\" and I was stunned. How did it know???  Well, no matter, the set-up was a friggin' breeze and I was thrilled how seamless it was.Operation was so much easier and while it still offers a little stuttering (which in all honesty is simply due to the black & white screen and how it operates) but it was decidedly better than the older model. Battery life is stellar, though not as good as amazon claims. I think what they say is almost absurdly optimistic. But, the truth is, a paperwhite will give you pretty great life on a full charge.It operates well, and I love how I can invert the screen so more of it is black. Not sure if that uses less battery like it does on an amoled phone screen, but I'm going to see and test it just in case. My old Kindle did not have this option.All in all, reading is fun again for me and I love how I don't need a special light to read in the middle of the night like I did with a hard back.

To my surprise, the increased ppi is very noticeable and welcome. The screen lights evenly and the increased size is pretty wonderful. It feels more \"real book\" size. The battery life seems excellent. One of the biggest nudges for me was that my old Paperwhite was starting to fall short. I would have to charge it after every book or so. The new one (Refurbished) used about 20% for a Brandon Sanderson book. Those are pretty quick reads, I would figure that was about 8 hours of use. Much better than the old one.My biggest complaint is that they went away from the inset screen, with the portion surrounding the reading area being part of the front screen. Fingerprints love it and it's easier to accidentally get them on the reading portion. The back also seems prone to acquiring a scuffed jean like appearance on the corners. At least, that's what I can figure from the refurbished one I received. It is why I moved to a new one. I didn't have any issues with the use of the refurbished model, but I'm unsure how much use is required to put those kinds of marks on the device, and would like to keep this one for a very long time.The comfort of holding the device is perfect.

You will not get this satisfaction with a Kindle, however what you do get is more practical. I love this Kindle when I read at night while lying in bed.

No more forcing my wrist into uncomfortable wrist-yoga poses to keep the pages open and at the best angle, especially with those super wide/lengthily books. I absolutely love it. I also saw a hack on TikTok where you can get a clicker to turn the page for you and a little arm that attaches to your bed/nightstand and will hold the kindle in place for you so you can have all your appendages comfortably under the warm covers and still be able to turn the pages. That will definitely be my next luxury purchase. I miss books and pages and all that, but it really is worth it. I also just got back from vacation and it was so much easier bringing my kindle instead of a few bulky books. And it was nice because the book I started reading I ended up abandoning in a few days and I just downloaded a new book.

{"asin": "B09RD7XM9X", "text": "My experience with the 16GB Amazon Kindle Paperwhite has been largely enjoyable, and it\u2019s brought a renewed sense of enthusiasm to my reading routine. However, there are a few points where it could be tweaked for an even better user experience. Here\u2019s a 5-star review, with a few friendly suggestions for improvement.A Pleasurable, Bigger Display \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f\ud83d\udcda: The 6.8\u201d display is significantly larger than in previous models and has transformed my reading experience. More words per page translate to fewer page turns, which contributes to a smoother flow in my reading. The sharp resolution mimics the look of printed text, combining the comfort of a physical book with the convenience of an e-reader.Customizable Warm Light, Easy on the Eyes \ud83d\udc40\u2728: The adjustable warm light feature is a game-changer for long reading sessions. It allows me to fine-tune the screen\u2019s warmth to match my surroundings, reducing eye strain whether I\u2019m reading in broad daylight or under dim lights before bed.Compact Library in Your Hand \ud83d\udcda\ud83c\udf92: The 16GB storage is a bibliophile\u2019s delight. It allows me to carry a wide range of books without the weight or bulk, perfect for travel or when I\u2019m just in the mood for options.Sleek Look, Comfortable Grip \ud83d\udd76\ufe0f\ud83d\udd90\ufe0f: The black design exudes elegance, and the rubberized back and smooth bezel around the screen ensure a comfortable grip for prolonged reading.Battery Life Worth Applauding \ud83d\udd0b\u23f1\ufe0f: Battery life is outstanding in the Kindle Paperwhite. It easily lasts for weeks on a single charge, making it an ideal companion for commutes, travels, or for avid readers who go through books like wildfire.However, there\u2019s a small aspect that may not appeal to everyone:A Bit on the Heavier Side \u2696\ufe0f\ud83e\udd14: While the larger screen size offers an enhanced reading experience, it does come with a slight increase in the overall size and weight. For those used to the feather-light feel of earlier models, this change could take some getting used to.All things considered, the Kindle Paperwhite 16GB confidently lands a 5-star rating \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f from me. Despite the minor size and weight adjustments, the brilliant display, adjustable warm light, ample storage, refined design, and excellent battery life more than compensate. If you\u2019re a book lover like me, I highly recommend giving this Kindle Paperwhite a go!

I always felt like I wanted just a bit more brightness sometimes.- You have the option to change the color/temperature of the screen to warm or cool options, so you can reduce eye strain at night with the warmer version.- This may be due to the case itself, but I purchased a super thin snap-on case for both this kindle and my last version, and this version of the Kindle is INCREDIBLE because it doesn\u2019t accidentally lock when I move the folded back cover of the case when reading.

While the screen is notably smaller, the ppi is almost double. I prefer not to use my reading glasses, and I can get the text large enough to comfortably read. Works well in bright sunlight by the pool or in dim light with the lighting turned on. Can read for hours at a time without any eye strain.Touch screen to turn pages works reasonably well. Every now and again I might touch the wrong place or perhaps double tap and I'm not where I expect to be, but that happens infrequently and isn't really a concern. I didn't pay extra to remove the ads, but they're not anything I even notice anymore. There's something on the screen when it starts up, but after the swipe to get started you never see any ads again. Certainly not worth $20 extra to remove that, and even then there's still extra stuff there.My public library has most every book I've wanted to read available as a kindle download. I download a number of books at a time (integration between the library's site and amazon's works very well and there's never a problem getting the books to the kindle) I then turn on airplane mode on the kindle and use the library's website to return the books. I can then read the books for as long as I want. When I'm finished with all the books I get another batch from the library.Battery life is reasonable, but not weeks. At least not if you use it for a few hours a day with the light on. I might get a week of usage before charging it again, but that's not unreasonable.I found a nice heavy, embossed, real leather cover for the kindle elsewhere that I've been happy with. Nice feel and it protects the device well (Oberon Design)While I thought I would have preferred something larger like my previous Kindle DX, this size just fits in cargo pants pockets or an overly large shirt pocket I have on some of my shirts.

Tried it once, couldn't delete it fast enough!You have to understand, I've only had one Kindle, and it's about 12 years old. I took good care of it, and had to replace the battery once, but it still worked.  Sort of. But turning pages took longer and longer. Often, it took so long, poor Kindle would just send an error message and give up. I wasn't even able to open some of the newer books. The replacement battery was losing its ability to hold a charge. Even worse, my Kindle case was literally falling apart, but my Kindle was so old, I couldn't find a replacement.So when I could postpone the inevitable no longer, I ordered the 11th Generation Paperwhite.When it came time to actually make the purchase, my palms sweated madly, but discovering the 16G was on sale\u2014making it cheaper than the 8G I'd decided was more financially affordable\u2014cheered me right up. Getting a trade-in that equaled one payment, and receiving a gift card that pretty much covered the cost of a new case, made it even better.The new Kindle arrived on time, and I was actually excited to try it out. There was just enough power in the battery to set it up before it needed charging. I'm quadriplegic, so the touch screen was a welcome change. I worried I'd be constantly swiping and wearing out my arm, but a tap is enough to turn pages. I like the lighted backscreen, which I didn't have before, and the wider size is easier for me to hold.Someone complained about the edge being too narrow to hold on to, but that's what the cases are for. I wouldn't recommend trying to use this product without a case to cover it. Not only does it protect the Kindle, but it makes it much easier to hold. I really love the way this Kindle sleeps when I close the cover, and wakes when I open it.I'm clumsy from nerve damage, so I sometimes touch the screen by accident, causing it to skip pages. But this device is so fast, I find my place again without difficulties. That was one of the things I worried about, before the purchase, but it's not a problem.What I don't like: the clock down in the bottom left corner. I turned it off, and when I briefly looked at another book, it turned back on again. When I turn something off, I want it to STAY OFF. And if I don't like it for one book, then I don't want it on any books\u2014but you have to turn off each book separately. And apparently, if you leave the book for any reason, then you have to turn it back off, AGAIN. When you've got issues with hands/arms, any extra click is too much.Let me turn it off in the device for ALL books, please, not just one book at a time.The other thing I hate is the way collections are managed. Before, when I added a book to a collection, that title was taken off the list. Now it stays on the list, so I have to scroll through EVERY book on the list, EVERY TIME. Since many book titles are similar\u2014especially books in the same genres\u2014that gets very confusing, very quickly. Not to mention, it's time consuming. Especially if you own over 1000 books!Just let me add a book to a collection, then take it off the complete list. Maybe you think I want to put it in multiple collections, Amazon, but I'd trade that option for ease and simplicity of use, any day.Also, I can't seem to get the highlight function to work. When I try, all I can get it to do is make a note. I've gone through the Kindle guide several times, and I've also searched online for an answer, but I can't find anything to explain why it won't give me a way to save a highlight. I often highlight passages to read to my sister; I don't want to make notes about them, just read them to her!Overall, I'm very pleased with this product. There are just a few, small annoyances that I'm apparently going to have to live with, I guess. I'd really, really like it if\u2014just once\u2014a new product kept all the good features and only 'improved' the bad ones. It's all about choice. Most of my unhappiness stems from the loss of a choice that I considered crucial.If Amazon had just left those easy little things unchanged, and given me the choice to do things the way I had become accustomed to doing, this would be a perfect product.", "title": "Mostly Pleased but Small Things Annoy", "location_and_date": "Reviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on February 10, 2023", "verified": true, "rating": "4.0"},

{"asin": "B09RD7XM9X", "text": "First, I want to clear up some confusion about airplane mode. Looking at reviews, I see complaints about battery life and the assumption airplane mode uses power. Wrong! Airplane mode means wireless communication is OFF. When you drive a car, the overdrive off light comes ON to tell you that feature is OFF. On a Kindle or phone or any device with airplane mode, that means the WiFi and bluetooth are OFF. (With a phone that also turns off cellular communication.)My previous Kindle  was/ is the paperwhite 8th edition. That Kindle recently started having problems like light not coming on, random restarts. So I bought this to replace my old PW before it quit working. This rest of this review is comparing this 11 gen vs 8 gen.This new model automatically puts books of same series into a folder. My 8gen simply showed all books in library. While reading there is an option to have a clock at top of screen, and time left to finish book at bottom. Time left is calculated from your reading speed. The adjustable light may be nice for some people, but for me I have it set to look like my old Kindle. There is a low power sleep option (device options, advanced). With this option enabled it takes a few seconds to wake up and use. I disabled that feature so I start reading when I want to. I have a third party ebook that takes about half a minute for 8gen to process, this new Kindle takes about 6 seconds. To transfer my content I plugged both Kindles into my PC. Both Kindles came up as external drives. I found the folders where content is stored, then copy and pasted. That is also how I load PDF and other third party content. My old kindle was bought December 2014 and got a lot of use. Battery life on old Kindle is still good, and I always use airplane mode except when downloading a new book.Overall, this feels like a waste of money if old Kindle were reliable. The new features are not worth it otherwise. I was worried the smaller border would make it difficult to hold without touching the screen, but I have not had a problem. The border can be widened to reduce accidental touching. I am using my new Kindle with CoBak case.

While reading on any Kindle is my preferred way of reading and transporting books, there are three grievances I have.#1 My previous Kindle opened up to the page I left off on. My new Kindle opens up to an ad for a book while it \u201cwakes up.\u201d  It then requires you to swipe to get to your reading material. I really don\u2019t like seeing an ad. I have purchased over 300 Kindle books. I get recommendation emails nearly daily. I know how and where to find reading material. When I\u2019m ready to read, I want to read, not look at an ad.#2 The power adapter for my new Kindle is not the mini USB. It is also not an Apple-compatible connector. All the mini USB cords I have purchased for my previous Kindle are useless. Device creators should be moving toward universal adapters, not creating new sizes and shapes. This is very frustrating and wasteful.#3 I always left the time on the top of my screen on my previous Kindle. When I\u2019m reading, I like to glance up to check the time. On my new Kindle, I have to open a drop down menu to see the time.

{"asin": "B09RD7XM9X", "text": "I got this last year as an upgrade to my Kindle Paperwhite 3.  After having used it for a year, I think I have settled on most of my opinions.  So, here's the breakdown:Pros:++ The screen is larger+ The resolution is sharper++ The warm light option is excellent, and one of its biggest selling points+ The internal software for calculating my reading speed is more accurate and more reliable.  It often glitched out on my Paperwhite 3 and got stuck believing that I read at god-level speeds.  Nothing like this has ever happened on my Paperwhite 5, although it still seems to generally underestimate how long it'll take me to finish a chapter.+ USB-C connection rather than micro-USB: this makes for delghtfully fast charging.+ It can store audiobooks and has bluetooth capabilities.  However, I have yet to take an interest in either of these functions.Cons:- It's actually a little bit LESS responsive than my Paperwhite 3.- The bezel is flush with the screen, which I suppose makes it waterproof, but it also makes the device harder to grip.- The bezel is too narrow for my tastes, since it again makes the device harder to grip without touching the screen.  Though, this issue can be mitigated by increasing the margin size.  The Kindle doesn't do anything with touch inputs that are sufficiently long and don't touch any words, so you can safely rest your thumb on the margins while you're reading.-- It takes significantly longer to wake up than my Paperwhite 3.  Part of that is because my Paperwhite 5 has ads on the lock screen, meaning I have to always swipe to unlock, which I don't have to do with my Paperwhite 3.  But even with this under consideration, when it's my first time turning the device on after a while, it usually takes around 1-3 seconds to prompt me to swipe to unlock, and another 1-2 seconds for it to actually load up my reading spot again.  It's especially bad when the Kindle is cool, e.g. under 60 degrees.  But my Paperwhite 3 was also a lot slower in cold air too, so this isn't too big of a gripe.-- I'm pretty sure the screen bleeding is worse in this model than for the Paperwhite 3.  Stray artifacts will sometimes stick around even after the screen refreshes, leaving traces of the previous screen state lingering on the device.  I've attached a photo to show you what I'm talking about.  In it, my Kindle is set to sleep mode, but you can see the words in the current book that I'm reading.  The Paperwhite 3 does this a bit too, but nowhere near as badly, and the screen refreshes are always successful.  This is a somewhat minor inconvenience, but it is a distraction sometimes.Overall, I'm not entirely sure if I can even call this an upgrade to the Paperwhite 3.  It has a lot of extra features that I love, and I guess at the end of the day, it's this model that I'm reading now and not my old Paperwhite 3.  But when I look back at my old Paperwhite 3, and consider the fact that it still works perfectly fine, I can't help but feel like I really didn't need this upgrade.So, if you're looking to pick up a new Kindle Paperwhite ... yeah, get the NEW Kindle Paperwhite.  The USB C charger, the larger screen, and the warm light are all major conveniences that make using the device a lot more enjoyable.  But if you are in the position I was in back in 2022, and you want to upgrade the Paperwhite that you already have, then save yourself the money and skip this.  You're not getting that much more, and you'll probably be trading off some features that you like in the process.", "title": "There are some things I really like about it, and also some things I really dislike about it", "location_and_date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2023", "verified": true, "rating": "3.0"},

{"asin": "B09RD7XM9X", "text": "So I came into possession of this little guy due to a late night Amazon impulse buy a few days before leaving for vacation. I was going on a weeklong  trip with my family and didn't want to have to bring my ipad (what I usually use to read) or any actual books with me on the plane. Let me preface this by saying I am an avid reader, spending the majority of my free time reading...and have been for most of my life. My siblings lament to anyone listening about the horror of summer road trips, riding in the back of our family sedan, fighting for leg room because I always had at least 5-6 books at my feet to read during our travels. You should hear the way my sister grumbles at even the mere mention of a car ride with me (She horribly dramatic) but I digress. I also used to have a nook e-reader, an original model Kindle from way back in the day that no longer works, and have the kindle app on my ipad which I use to read most days. So I am familiar with e-reading. This kindle is quite possibly the best purchase I've ever made. It's basically pocket sized so it was extremely portable. I brought it with me everywhere; On the plane, in the car, in my bag to restaurants...I even managed to fit it in a particularly spacious pocket of an oversized jean jacket I wore on cooler nights. It's amazing. It was comfortable enough to hold in one hand, or two, depending on what I preferred at the time. The various light options on the kindle, including the warm light feature makes it easy to read regardless of where I was and what kind of lighting is available, without eye strain. I shared a room with family for a couple of nights and the dark mode feature barely emits light past my immediate person, so I was able to read into the wee hours of the morning if I wanted to without disturbing my family sleeping in the same room, or sacrificing my precious reading time. ( I get particularly sassy if I'm interrupted in the middle of a discovering a plot twist in a juicy novel, i'm just saying). You are able to customize lots of the settings, such as the fonts, size, spacing and layout, so that the books look however you want them to while reading. (I definitely used that feature to make the font smaller and more compact while I read an embarrassingly cringleworthy, but suprisingly emotional and fantastic, harlequin romance novel while on the plane. It's nobody's business why I was practically sobbing into my complimentary pretzels after the protagonists romantic interest declared his love to her for the first time, thank you very much) I also may, or may not have had a TINY accident in which I spilled my entire 32oz water bottle full of water all over my pants and my kindle. After squealing in alarm at how cold the water was, I was able to get my bearings, wiped the water off the kindle, changed my pants and continued reading. I have noted no damage whatsoever to my kindle and that was at the beginning of my trip well over a week ago now. After reading every day for at least 4-6 hours per day/night for 7 days straight I had 57% battery left over. I think the battery is supposed to last for 2 weeks maybe? IDK. Basically it lasted a long time, long enough for me to be impressed. Also, I downloaded at least 15 new books on there, not to mention the impressive collection of books I already owned and was able to sync to the device, and I still have over 4GB of space available to use. I have since named the kindle Kurt, as I feel emotionally connected to the device after our adventures together these past weeks. If you are a super bookworm like me, or are just trying to finish a whole book for the first time, I highly recommend this device for purchase. I think it was worth the money a thousand times over. And if after reading this you do decide to purchase it, I hope you love it just as much as I do.", "title": "Perfect for travel...and the rest of your days", "location_and_date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2022", "verified": true, "rating": "5.0"},

I was under I\u2019d this upgrade was worth buying a new kindle. I was intrigued by the larger screen and the option for warm light. I was wary of purchasing because from what it looked like online, the kindles were almost the same size.Though the new kindle itself is only a few cm wider/taller than the last version, the screen itself is wayyyy larger. It\u2019s a huge difference for the reading experience. I am loving the larger screen. I also like warm mode. I keep it on halfway warm mode all the time. You can set a schedule and have your kindle get warmer with the sunset and rise which is pretty cool. I\u2019m super picky so I like to set my own brightness and warmth all the time. In the photo you can see the significant size difference. The new larger size has a negligible effect on the weight. I put a pop socket on all my kindles and with the pop sockets on, I almost can\u2019t tell a difference between the two. If you are a very avid reader and want the larger screen, I say go for it. I bought on prime day and was able to get ad free for only $109. My old kindle started to give out on the battery side of things. When I first got it, it stayed charged for weeks! I read a few hours every day and it would remain charged for a long time. At the end it would only last me about 2-3 days or 12 hours of read time. The new paperwhite (from what I can tell) keeps a charge for a very long time. I\u2019ve put about 8 hours of read time on her so far and she still has 84% battery.

Stupid easy). I'm really disappointed in the epically bad tech support I got from Amazon today. The device is ok. I'm not loving it yet, but I hope I do eventually.
